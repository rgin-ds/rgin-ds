ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Arjun

I'm a curious person interested in deploying Machine Learning models to draw business and social insights from self-scraped data. 
On top of working with busyQA as their database QA analyst/data scientist, I am also busy with a number of NLP projects related to social media and the 2020 Election.

I'm especially interested in AI ethics and the issue of interpretability in data science. 
In my free time, you'll find me deep-diving into a multitude of different topics or listening to my favourite podcast.

Love making new connections and meeting people so please feel free to reach out.
